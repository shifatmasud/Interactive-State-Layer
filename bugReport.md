## Critical

- (None)

## Warning

- **2024-05-21 11:00 AM**: On extremely rapid mouse movements, there can be a slight perceived lag in the animation's origin point. This is inherent to the browser's event loop and state update cycle, but could be investigated for micro-optimization.

## Suggestion

- **2024-05-21 12:00 PM**: The state layer could have a more complex gradient or texture for added visual appeal.
- **2024-05-21 12:05 PM**: Consider adding a subtle sound effect on enter/leave for a more immersive multi-sensory experience.
